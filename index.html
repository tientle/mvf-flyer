        <h1>Hi, I'm Tien!</h1>
        <p>I'm participating in the <b> 2025 Miss Vietnam Florida</b> pageant along with 10 other wonderful contestants on February 16, 2025. <br><br> Learn more about us here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missvietnamflorida/" target="_blank">@missvietnamflorida</a>

            
        <br><br> For our philanthropy, we are raising money for a scholarship fund to help local Vietnamese students. My goal is to raise 1,500 dollars! <br><br> You can donate through GoFundMe, Venmo, or Zelle.

                I'm gathering data on all things related to love. I would love to hear about the things you love, and how they have shaped your life. The answers can be as silly, fun, serious, etc as you like. You don't have to answer every question, but it would be helpful if you could. Anyone can fill this form out, so feel free to share it around. <br> <br> <a href="https://forms.gle/FY8bZaLcCY2Mxn8dA" target="_blank">üîó https://forms.gle/FY8bZaLcCY2Mxn8dA</a>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I graduated from the University of Florida in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Journalism. üêä 
            <br> <br>
            During my time at UF, I was a teaching assistant for an Advanced Web Applications, researcher on patient-clinician communication in telehealth and hospital settings, studies, and a part of the Asian American community at UF through alpha Kappa Delta Phi. 
            <br> <br>
            I developed a passion for the intersection of data, design, and code. This led me to <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1059858123/tien-le" target="_blank"> NPR's Digital News and Data Graphics team</a> where I was able to write about the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/12/1045182583/nfl-locker-room-sandwiches-lead-to-a-debate-over-the-perfect-pb-j-ratio" target="_blank">NFL's peanut butter jelly sandwich preferences</a>
            and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/30/1060057901/spacewalk-delay-space-debris-junk" target="_blank">NASA astronauts</a>. I was awarded a national <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2022/08/11/1117012722/npr-wins-six-edward-r-murrow-awards" target="_blank">Edward R. Murrow Award for my contributions to COVID-19 trackers</a>. I've also been a part of Business Insider's Creative Team, creating data graphics for stories ranging from the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-championship-winners-five-teams-dominate-since-1980-2022-6" target="_blank">NBA</a> to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-crisis-environmental-policy-congress-legislation-2022-9" target="_blank">politics</a>. 

            <br> <br>
            Through my work, I've become passionate about data and media literacy. I believe that everyone deserves fair and equal access to accurate information, education, and the ability to understand the world around them. 
            <br> <br>
            To me, this pageant is an opportunity to connect with my local Vietnamese community, make a tangible impact, and keep in touch with my Vietnamese roots.  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î
